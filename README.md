# advanced-css

For this assignment I made a basic profile page. Given no starter code, I started my code in HTmL. I built the page using what we learned in class. 
I was able to make my links navigate and at the bottom allow a link to send me an email. After this I went to my css files and started building the 
page that way. 

I created 3 sections. An about me, contact me, and my work. 

I used place holder images to take up space on my page.
